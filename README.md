# Data Structure
Data Structure is a method of organizing information, so that information can be stored and retrieved efficiently.
All Data structure house and hold some kind of data. A structure is just a synonym for a home. The data that is housed in the structure could be something as simple as a number or complex as a strand of DNA.
Data Structure us not defined by the data, is just a place to keep and organize.

### Big O Notation
This notation describes an data structure's function complexity. 


### Stack (Pilha)
The element of the top of stack is the last one added. There is an order how data enter and leaves the data structure. The last card placed is the first to leave. This is know as LIFO (Last In First Out).

 - Push, put the data on top      -> O(1) -> Constant
 - Pop, take off the data on top  -> O(1) -> Constant
 - Search, need to pop until find -> O(n) -> Linear
